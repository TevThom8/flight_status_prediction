Flight Status Prediction Analysis

This analysis focuses on predicting flight status using historical flight data. The objective is to leverage data science and machine learning techniques to develop predictive models that can assist stakeholders in the aviation industry with managing flight schedules more effectively and enhancing customer satisfaction.

Project Goals

	•	Understand the Problem: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors influencing flight status.
	•	Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for machine learning.
	•	Feature Engineering: Develop new features to improve model performance.
	•	Model Training and Evaluation: Train and assess various machine learning models to predict flight status.
	•	Focused Analysis on Busiest Airports: Conduct a detailed analysis using data from the busiest airports to manage computational constraints.

Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises information on thousands of flights, including:

	•	Departure and arrival delays
	•	Airlines
	•	Airports
	•	Additional flight details

This extensive dataset provides a solid foundation for developing accurate predictive models.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Inspection

	•	Examining the shape and structure of the dataset.

Missing Values

	•	Identifying and addressing missing values.

Data Visualization

	•	Utilizing visualizations to understand feature distributions and relationships.

Key Insights

	•	A strong positive correlation between arrival and departure delays.
	•	Significant correlations between scheduled and actual departure and arrival times.

Data Preprocessing

Filtering Data

	•	Focusing on flights departing from the busiest airports to manage computational load.

Feature Selection

	•	Choosing relevant features for prediction.

Handling Missing Values

	•	Imputing or removing missing data as necessary.

Normalization

	•	Scaling numerical features to enhance model performance.

Feature Engineering

To improve the predictive power of the models, several new features were engineered:

Time-based Features

	•	Extracting features such as departure hour, day of the week, and month.

Interaction Features

	•	Creating features representing interactions between different variables (e.g., airline and departure time).

Model Training and Evaluation

Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including:

	1.	Logistic Regression
	2.	Decision Trees
	3.	Random Forests
	4.	Gradient Boosting

Each model’s performance was assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation was performed to ensure robust results. The Random Forest model emerged as the best-performing model, offering a good balance between precision and recall.
